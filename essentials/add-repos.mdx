## Add Squire to GitHub Repos
After you've installed Squire, you can add Squire to more repositories via the GitHub UI.

<Note>
You'll need to have an administrator of your GitHub organization add Squire to other repositories due to GitHub's permissions.
</Note>

The URL to add Squire to your repositories is different depending on your organizations GitHub name, it will follow this structure:
```
https://github.com/organizations/*YourOrganizationGitHubName*/settings/installations
```

You'll find the setting by going to your Organization's settings, then under **Third-party Access** select **GitHub Apps**, Select Squire, then pick additional repositories or All repositories.

Once you've added new repositories, give Squire 2 minutes to sync and then we'll be in business.
