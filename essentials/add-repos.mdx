## Add Squire to GitHub Repos
After you've installed Squire, you can add Squire to more repositories via the GitHub UI.

You'll find the setting by going to your Organization's settings, then under **Third-party Access** select **GitHub Apps**, Select Squire, then pick additional repositories or All repositories.

Once you've added new repositories, give Squire 2 minutes to sync and then we'll be in business.
