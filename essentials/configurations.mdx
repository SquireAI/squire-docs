<Note>
Configurations are optional. Squire will use [defaults](/essentials/configurations#squires-default-configurations) otherwise.
</Note>

## What you can Configure
Squire allow's you to configure the following:
- If you want an introComment: Squire comments with a description of what it can do and it's commands, you can turn this off.
- If you want a PR summary: Squire will write a summary and changes in the PR description if left blank, you can turn this off.
- If you want a code review: Squire will automatically review your PR on creation, you can turn this off.
- Ignore settings for autoReview, introComment, and PR summaries: you can have Squire ignore specific base branches for these three (3) settings by using glob patterns. Syntax example in [Setting up Configurations](#setting-up-configurations).
- Add [custom standards](/features/standards) to Squire to help review code to your companies standards.

### Squire's Default Configurations
Squire's default configurations are designed to provide a balance between providing feedback and not overwhelming you with comments.  

## Setting up Configurations
Add a `squire.config.json` file to your repositories root.

Here is an example of what you can add to your `squire.config.json` file:

```json
{
  "review": {
    "auto": {
      "enabled": true,
      "ignoreBranches": ["production", "staging"]
    },
  },
  "summary": {
    "auto": {
      "enabled": true,
      "ignoreBranches": []
    }
  },
  "introComment": {
    "auto": {
      "enabled": true,
      "ignoreBranches": []
    }
  }
}
```
In this configuration:

- review.auto: Controls whether the review feature is enabled and specifies branches to ignore via glob patterns.
- review.auto.ignoreBranches: Squire will **not** review code being merged into the base branches of: `"production" & "staging"`.
- summary.auto: Controls whether the summary feature is enabled and specifies branches to ignore via glob patterns.
- introComment.auto: Controls whether the intro comment is enabled and specifies branches to ignore via glob patterns.
