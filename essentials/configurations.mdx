<Note>
Configurations are optional. Squire will use it's [defaults](/essentials/configurations#squires-default-configurations) if you do not add a squire.config.json file to your repositories root.
</Note>

## What you can Configure
Squire allow's you to configure the following:
- Code review feedback: You can adjust the weights for [Severity & Confidence](/features/code-review#configurations-for-code-review). Lower scores means more comments and higher scores means less comments.
- Custom review instructions: You can add rules for Squire to follow when performing a code review. Ex. `Please do not ask me to \"make sure\" of anything`
- If you want an introComment: Squire comments with a description of the PR, you can turn this off.
- autoReview: Squire will automatically review your PR on create, you can turn this off.
- Ignore settings for autoReview, introComment, and PR summaries: you can have Squire ignore specific branches for these three (3) settings by using glob patterns. Syntax example in [Setting up Configurations](#setting-up-configurations).

### Squire's Default Configurations
Squire's default configurations are:
- Severity: 5
- Confidence: 5
- No custom review instructions
- Squire posts an introduction message as a comment
- autoReview is on

If you do not add a squire.config.json file to your repositories root, Squire will use these [defaults](/essentials/configurations#squires-default-configurations).

## Setting up Configurations
Add a `squire.config.json` file to your repositories root.

Here is an example of what you can add to your `squire.config.json` file:

```json
{
  "review": {
    "auto": {
      "enabled": true,
      "ignoreBranches": ["production/*", "staging/*"]
    },
    "reviewInstructions": [
      "Please do not ask me to \"make sure\" of anything",
      "Make sure all database options use custom repositories"
    ],
    "minConfidence": 8,
    "minSeverity": 7
  },
  "summary": {
    "auto": {
      "enabled": true,
      "ignoreBranches": []
    }
  },
  "introComment": {
    "auto": {
      "enabled": true,
      "ignoreBranches": []
    }
  }
}
```
In this configuration:

- review.auto: Controls whether the review feature is enabled and specifies branches to ignore via glob patterns.
- review.reviewInstructions: Custom instructions for the code review process.
- review.minConfidence: Minimum confidence of 8/10 required for a review comment.
- review.minSeverity: Minimum severity of 7/10 required for a review comment.
- summary.auto: Controls whether the summary feature is enabled and specifies branches to ignore via glob patterns.
- introComment.auto: Controls whether the intro comment feature is enabled and specifies branches to ignore via glob patterns.
