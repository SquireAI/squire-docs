## Write Code Constraints
Squire's ability to [write code](/features/write-code) is optimized for Typescript code only (`.ts` & `.tsx`). Very quickly we’ll be opening up our code writing capabilities to all languages when we’re satisfied with our outputs.

If you want us to consider a specific language send us a note founders@squire.ai

## PR Constraints
Currently you can not call Squire on the PR that it opens itself.

To put this in context with an example:
1. You have an open PR and ask Squire to fix some problems it found during [code review](/features/code-review).
2. Squire opens a new PR against yours with the code changes.
3. You try to ask Squire to make another code review on Squire's open PR - this will not work.

## Interaction Constraints

When you invoke Squire to complete a task treat it like any other engineer, trust that we are working on the change and will post a PR asap. You can see Squire's progress in GitHub's checks. If you update your PR after calling Squire, but before we respond, you should expect a merge conflict accordingly.

There are some other example scenarios that could cause merge conflicts during the GitHub workflow today:
- If you update the existing PR after our bot has shipped a PR
- If you call Squire to make a fix, then update your PR, then try to merge our PR

We will not resolve merge conflicts.
