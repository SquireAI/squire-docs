Working with Squire is almost exactly like working with any other engineering during the PR flow when you’re asking them to make a change. The only requirement is to @ mention @squire in order to invoke the bot to start working.

*Please note*: You will get much better results if you name the objects you want changed.
Example: If you want a variable renamed to be more descriptive say `@echolayer change ‘ee’ to be more descriptive`
