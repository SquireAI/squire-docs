Working with Squire is simple, with [defaults](/configurations#squires-default-configurations), Squire will write [pull descriptions](/features/pull-request-description) and [review PRs](/features/code-review) on creation.

You can also ask for more reviews after further commits by invoking Squire to [review your code](/features/code-review) with `/squire review`.

Then teach Squire to [review code the way you like it](/features/squire-learns) by giving 👍 or 👎 reactions to comments.
