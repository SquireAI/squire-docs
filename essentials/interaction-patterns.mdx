Working with Squire is like working with any other engineer during the PR flow, only **you get to tell Squire exactly what to work on.**

You do this by invoking Squire to [review your code](/features/code-review) with `/squire review`.

Then asking Squire to [make code changes](/features/write-code) for you with üëç reactions followed by `/squire ship` to get a PR.
