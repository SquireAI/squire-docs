Squire will add a summary & changelog with any of these three methods:
- If you leave the PR description blank, we will fill it for you
- If you use a PR template, you can now add `{{/squire summary}}` & `{{/squire changes}}`
- If you edit a description and add either tag we will fill it after you save with the most up to date summary & changes

You can also [update summaries](/features/pull-request-description#update-summaries-after-further-commits) after futher commits.

## Add summaries to GitHub template

### Steal this template

    ```markdown
   # Description

    {{/squire summary}}

    ## Changes

    {{/squire changes}}

    ## Type of Change
    <!-- PLEASE DELETE OPTIONS WHICH DON'T APPLY -->

    - [ ] Tech Debt (refactoring, unit tests, CI changes, pre-commit hooks, etc)
    - [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
    - [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
    - [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)

    ## How Has This Been Tested?
    <!-- 
        Write unit tests; PRs with no tests will generally not be accepted
        Describe any manual tests that you ran to verify your changes. 
        Provide instructions so we can reproduce.

## Update Summaries after further commits
Often Squire wrote your first PR description & changelog, but you've made more commits.

You can update the PR description to the most recent commit & changes by using this command in a comment:
```json
/squire update-description
``` 
This will update the description to include all commits since the last description was written.

You can also use this command to get an updated summary of the PR as a comment in case you don't want to update the PR description.
```json
/squire summary
```
