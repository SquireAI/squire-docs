Rules are the guidelines that helps Squire review your code to your companies standards.

You will see labels on all Squire comments that show the rule that was used or violated in generating the comment. If you click on it, you will see the full rule in Squire's dashboard.

You can view the rules Squire uses to review your code by logging into the [Squire dashboard](https://app.squire.ai).

You can also provide custom rules to Squire to use in your repositories.

To add a custom rule:
- Go to the [Squire dashboard](https://app.squire.ai)
- Click on the repository you want to add a rule to
- Click on the 'create rule' button

- Write what you want Squire to check for in plain English

### Under the Hood üèéÔ∏è

- Everytime Squire is reviewing a diff in a code review, it'll check the rules for that repository.
- If a change is made which violates a rule, Squire will identify this, and leave a comment in the PR.

### What makes a good rule?

- A good rule is clear and concise

Ex.
```markdown
‚úÖ Good Example:

All functions should be accompanied by clear documentation and comments in the form of docstrings for better understanding and maintenance.

‚ùå Bad Example:
Include documentation for functions.
```

- A good rule provides examples

```markdown
‚úÖ Good Example:
Implement proper error handling to prevent the application from crashing and provide meaningful error messages.
Example:
~~~python
# Python: No error handling
file = open('data.txt', 'r')
data = file.read()

# Fix: Add error handling
try:
    with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file 'data.txt' was not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
~~~
```

- A good rule is objective

```
‚úÖ Good Example:
Functions should have no more than 20 lines of code.

‚ùå Bad Example:
Functions should not be too long.
```


In addition to rules [Squire learns](/features/squire-learns) from your üëç or üëé feedback on comments during reviews to provide even better reviews for you over time.
