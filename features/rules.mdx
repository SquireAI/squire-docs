Rules are the guidelines that helps Squire review your code to your companies standards.

You will see labels on all Squire comments that show the rule that was used or violated in generating the comment. If you click on it, you will see the full rule in Squire's dashboard.

You can view the rules Squire uses to review your code by logging into the [Squire dashboard](https://app.squire.ai).

You can also provide custom rules to Squire to use in your repositories.

To add a custom rule:
- Go to the [Squire dashboard](https://app.squire.ai)
- Click on the repository you want to add a rule to
- Click on the 'create rule' button

In addition to rules [Squire learns](/features/squire-learns) from your üëç or üëé feedback on comments during reviews to provide even better reviews for you over time.
