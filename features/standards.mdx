Standards are the rules and guidelines that help Squire review your code to your companies standards. You can view the standards Squire uses to review your code by logging into the Squire dashboard.

You teach Squire by reacting to any Squire comments:
- a thumbs up emoji 👍 for "more comments like these" or;
- a thumbs down emoji 👎 for "less comments like these"
