Standards are the rules and guidelines that help Squire review your code to your companies standards.

You will see labels on all Squire comments now that show the standard that was used or violated in generating the comment. If you click on it, you will see the full standard in Squire's dashboard.

You can view the standards Squire uses to review your code by logging into the [Squire dashboard](https://app.squire.ai).

You can also provide custom standards to Squire to use in your repositories. If you are interested in adding standards to Squire, please reach out to founders@squire.ai.

In addition to standards [Squire learns](/features/squire-learns) from your 👍 or 👎 feedback on comments during reviews to provide even better reviews for you over time.
