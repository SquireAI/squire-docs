Once Squire has completed [a code review](/features/code-review), you can ask Squire to make code changes for you.

You ask for changes by:
1. Reacting to a Squire comment with a thumbs up emoji üëç.
2. You can react to as many Squire comments as you want fixed, 1 - n.
3. Write a comment with `/squire ship`.
4. Squire will then create a new PR with the changes you requested.

While Squire is working you'll see a GitHub check running.
