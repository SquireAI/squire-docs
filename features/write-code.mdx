Once Squire has completed [a code review](/features/code-review), you can ask Squire to make code changes for you.

You ask for changes by:
1. Reacting to a Squire comment with a thumbs up emoji üëç.
2. You can react to as many Squire comments as you want fixed, 1 - n.
3. Write a comment with `/squire ship`.
4. Squire will then create a new PR with the changes you requested.

While Squire is working you'll see a GitHub check running.

<Note>
Today Squire has a constraint of working with `Typescript`, including `React`, repositories only. This allows our team to ensure accuracy in code changes during our code gen alpha, please select a repository with typescript in order to get full value today. If you want us to consider a specific language send us a note founders@squire.ai
