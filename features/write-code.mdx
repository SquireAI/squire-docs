When on an open PR you can invoke Squire by @ mentioning `@squire` along with the work you want us to take care of.
Specifically there are two ways:
1. You highlight a line (or lines), invoke Squire along with your instructions, and select “add single comment”
2. You can also “start a review” then add as many requests as you want. Once complete and you “Submit review” Squire will complete each task you’ve given it throughout the review.

## Example

`@squire can you camelCase 'parsed_query'?`
