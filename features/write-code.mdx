Once Squire has completed [a code review](/features/code-review), you can ask Squire to make code changes for you.

You ask for changes by:

<Steps>
  <Step title="React">
    Reacting to any Squire comments with a thumbs up emoji üëç. *You can react to as many Squire comments as you want, 1 - n.*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request a diff">
    Write a comment with `/squire ship`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">
    Squire will then create a new PR with the changes you requested. Review it, cherry pick commits if necessary, and merge it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

While Squire is working you'll see a GitHub check running.

<Note>
Today Squire has a constraint of working with `Typescript`, including `React`, repositories only. This allows our team to ensure accuracy in code changes during our code gen alpha, please select a repository with typescript in order to get full value today. If you want us to consider a specific language send us a note founders@squire.ai
